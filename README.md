# Pacman
-This is the example for my Pacman exercise done in during the first half of the bootcamp with MIT.
-During this assignment, we learned how to make multiple pacmen on one program and how to manipualte the movement and speed of the image. I am currently also working on a project that will create a full pacman simulation and will be uploading that, when finished, to github as well. I hope you enjoy!
